TODO:
As tasks are completed leave a * next to them if you wouldnt mind.


Create assets:

    Art:
    The following will most likely be needed at minimun I (Owen) will try to stamp most of these out asap, may leave the background to last

        Player asset ~ a pirate ship
      
        Enemy 1 asset ~ a naval ship
      
        Enemy 2 asset ~ a sea monster (giant fish/snake)
      
        Boss ~ A giant octopus
            This will consist of multiple assets being:
                The octopuses arms
                The octopuses main body/head
                Possibly an under side for the octopus
      
        Background ~ A sea, This will be a large scale image most likely stiched from end to end and extended out much longer in once direction as it is inteded to scroll along as the game progress
            It is possible that we may introduce different themes along the map to introduce diversity such as a stormy area but the changes will most likely be minimal to the gameplay
    
    Sound Design:
    We should start with some basic sounds from cc resources and if time is available we can make addition pieces

        Canon fire for player and navy

        explosion for hit registration

        A sound for the monsters and the boss, if we need to these can share one sound

    Additionally we can find these sounds if desired

        sounds for the naval ships spawning and the player taking damage, they can be similar sounds such as cheers in different picthes.

Code:

    Well start with code that uses much of the stuff weve seen up until the second assignment, from which well have to start adding stuff ahead of schedule / along with later assignments. For now, the things we know we need

        Scrolling the ship must move along with the a screen that is constantly moving in the same direction

        much later down the line well have to figure out kinematics for the octopus
